Research modern dashboard UI best practices (Tailwind CSS), then audit 
the current project's styling. Write findings to STYLING_AUDIT.md and 
a plan to STYLING_PLAN.md. Focus on: spacing consistency, color hierarchy, 
typography scale, hover/focus states, shadows, transitions, responsive 
breakpoints, and accessibility. 

Do NOT implement changes until I approve the plan.
